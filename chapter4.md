# 4.1.1 Function Definitions
**Finger exercise 1**: Use the find_root function in Figure 4-3 to print the sum of approximations to the square root of 25, the cube root of -8, and the fourth root of 16. Use 0.001 as epsilon.

**Finger exercise 2**: Write a function is_in that accepts two strings as arguments and returns True if either string occurs anywhere in the other, and False otherwise. Hint: you might want to use the built-in str operator in.

**Finger exercise 3**: Write a function to test is_in.
