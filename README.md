# Journey to Data Science üë®‚Äçüíª

Welcome! This repository is a personal record of my learning journey into the world of **Data Science**. As a *broke old noob* trying to carve my path into this field, I created this space to document my progress, share solutions to finger exercises, and explore the functionality of GitHub along the way.

## Purpose
- This repository is purely for **academic purposes**.
- It serves as a log of my progress as I work through *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python* by **John V. Guttag**.
- All answers have been reviewed and refined with the help of **AI tools** to ensure accuracy and clarity.

## Acknowledgments
Infinite gratitude to **MIT OpenCourseWare** for their incredible resources that make high-quality education accessible to everyone. üôè

## Notes
